\begin{abstract}
The foreign exchange market (Forex) is the worldâ€™s largest foreign money trade market with over 5.1 trillion of trade exchange per day. It is recognized to be very complicated and volatile. Technical analysis is the observation of past market motion with the scope to forecast future prices and to deal with the effect of the market movement. A trading system is based on technical indicators derived from the technical analysis. In our work, a complete trading system using a combination of trading rules on Forex time series data is developed and provided to the scientific community. The implementation of the system is realized in two phases: in the first phase, each trading rule, both the AI-based rule and the trading rules from technical indicators, are tested for selection and in the second phase, profitable rules among the qualified rules are selected and combined. Training data is used in the learning step of the trading system. The proposed trading system was extensively trained and tested on historical data spanning from 2010 until 2021. A particular focus was given to the training of our AI-based rule with a convolutional neural network. Results clearly answer to the main question which guided our research and that is the title of this article.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, a complete trading system on Forex time series data is developed using a combination of trading rules. The idea to combine trading rules is borrowed by the real world of trading, where traders and analysts, before investing on the market, try to confirm their decision using different approaches and indicators. We provide to the community the implemented trading system, which was developed using the MetaEditor as IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for MQL5.

The implementation of the system is realized in two phases: in the first phase, each trading rule, both the AI-based rule and the trading rules from technical indicators, are tested for selection and in the second phase, profitable rules among the qualified rules are selected and combined. Training data is used in the learning step of the trading system.

A particular focus was given to the training of our AI-based rule with a convolutional neural network (CNN). Results clearly answer to the main question which guided our research: \textit{Is Deep Learning a method to improve technical analysis on Forex data to forecast future price action?}. The answer is currently negative. In general, the approaches based on neural networks are evaluated in the most of cases only considering their prediction error, without considering the entire effect on a broader trading system where the decision to open a position, i.e. to invest, is as important as the decision to close the position. We went beyond this limitation and considered a real working trading system.

The proposed trading system was extensively trained on historical data, measured at 4-hours intervals candlesticks, of 6 currency pairs: 4 major pairs like GBP/USD, EUR/USD, USD/CHF and USD/JPY, and 2 minor pairs like EUR/GBP and GBP/JPY. The entire dataset spans from 01-01-2010 till 30-04-2021 and we conducted thorough experiments on the aforementioned currency pairs on 3 test sets constituted by the entire year 2019, the entire year 2020 and current time interval for year 2021 (from 01-01 till 30-04). 
For almost all currency pairs during the three long considered time intervals our system has produced stable and high profitable results 
%The outcomes highlighted how our approach can achieve profit yearly based from +35\% to +155\%, 
keeping a low risk profile where the deposit load (the percent of account funds used to open positions) was always below 25\%. We conclude that the best strategy is to invest simultaneously on all of the currency to reduce the loss risk and stay profitable, since, in financial domain, it is not easy to construct a stable mechanism that always generates profit.

As future works, we would like to investigate how deep learning algorithms behave when we use them not only for the technical analysis but in combination with the fundamental analysis, where several  factors such as the financial system and political state of a country, all inner and exterior buying and selling news, etc. are considered. Furthermore, different methodologies can be considered on how to combine trading rules beyond the hard voting approach proposed in this work.
In conclusion, several time interval candlesticks experiments, not only limited to H4, can be conducted.
