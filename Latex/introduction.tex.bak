\section{Introduction}

People are involved more and more in trading of currencies these days. Amongst those markets, of the biggest buying and selling platforms are cryptocurrency trading and the FOREX marketplace.
Although cryptocurrency promises better returns than foreign exchange, FOREX gives solid, especially secured, and relatively regulated trading in comparison to cryptocurrency trading.
As a result, in latest years, the foreign exchange (FOREX) market has attracted pretty a lot of interest from researchers all over the world. Different kinds of studies have been performed to accomplish the task of predicting future FOREX currency prices accurately.

Researchers have been involved primarily in neural networks models, pattern-based approaches, and optimization techniques. 
The emergence of artificial neural networks performed a massive function in foreign exchange rate prediction. Due to its predictive capabilities, many researchers used neural networks for their prediction models. During our evalutaion of related works, we discovered that many deep learning algorithms, such as gated recurrent unit (GRU) and long short term memory (LSTM), have been explored and exhibit massive potential in time sequence prediction.

The foreign exchange market, is the worldâ€™s largest foreign money trade market with over $5.1$ trillion of trade exchange per day. It is recognized to be very complicated and volatile. Currency trading occurs 24 h a day, however the buying and selling time is divided into 4 fundamental time zones. Each of these zones has its specific opening hours and closing hours.
FOREX is divided into three specific categories: majors, cross-rates, and exotics. Majors are the most traded currencies which are priced in opposition to the USD and occupy the majority of the FOREX market. Our work is primarily based on Majors.

Each forex pair has its opening price, highest price, lowest price, and closing price based on the trading session. For security reasons, it is now not possible for one person to at once go to, register with, and purchase from the FOREX market,  but each individual needs to use third party like brokers, who are humans or corporations that have admission to the FOREX market and are capable to buy or sell currencies. In the FOREX market, solely two alternatives are available, either buying currencies or selling if they have brought any currencies previously. 

Recent years have viewed a lot of researches in the FOREX market foreign money rate prediction. Predicting the FOREX market has been a key goal of investigators over the preceding couple of decades. There are two methods to forecast the market: undamental research and technical research. Fundamental research considers many factors, such as the financial system and political state of a country, the popularity of a company, all inner and exterior buying and selling news, etc. Technical research concentrates predicting the FOREX market based totally on historic data, in particular, the highest price, lowest price, opening price, and closing price of a currency and the volume traded on a particular day. 

The remainder of the paper is arranged as follows.
