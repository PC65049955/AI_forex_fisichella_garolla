\section{Experiments}
All our experiments are reproducible with the code of our final implemented expert advisor publicly available~\footnote{https://git.l3s.uni-hannover.de/mfisichella/forex}.

\subsection{Investment Setup}
\noindent In our experiments we used the following configuration:

\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0.3em}
\item Our investment was limited to \$ 10000.
\item For each transaction, we allocated the amount indicated by the money management risk presented in Section~\ref{sec:tradsys} with an upper limit to 4\% of the current available capital.
\item The leverage was set to 1:30. 
\item The ideal execution for order placement with zero latency during trading execution was chosen.
\item We used a demo account with a trading broker \footnote{https://www.icmarkets.com/en/open-trading-account/demo/} simulating the placement of buy/sell positions.
\end{itemize}
