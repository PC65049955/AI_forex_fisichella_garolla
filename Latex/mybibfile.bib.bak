Inspired by ARMA model we propose a dataset composed of historical data of USD/EUR and (JYN, EUR and BRP) variations. The dataset is used to train four regression algorithms: Multiple linear regression, Support vector regression, Partial Least Squares regression and CRT regression tree; the generated regression weights of these algorithms will be used as inputs to Cuckoo Search algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed system against classical regression algorithms is confirmed by experiments on exchange rate prediction within the period from January 2014 to January 2016.",

	abstract = {We generate a large number of predictive models by applying linear kernel SVR to historical currency rates'bid data for three currency pairs obtained from high-frequency trading. The bid tick data are converted into equally spaced (1 min) data. Differences of price between the previous successive timeframes are used as features to predict the direction of movement of the price in the next timeframe. Different values for the number of training samples, number of features, and the length of the timeframes are used when learning the models. These models are used to conduct simulated currency trading in the year following the one in which the model was learned. Profits (sum of realized differences in best bid prices when order is executed), hit ratios, and number of trades executed using these models are recorded. The experiments indicate that while it is difficult to construct models using only historical data that consistently perform well, there are models that show good performance under certain pre-defined conditions, and that many of these models have an interesting property. Upon examining the parameters of these models, we discover that they have all negative coefficients and a negligibly small intercept, while having positive profits and good hit ratio. This suggests a simple yet effective trading strategy. Finally, we examine the historical data to find corroboration for the pattern suggested by the generated models and present the results.},

In this direction, the Modified Renko Bars (MRBs) were developed first; that proved to be a useful trading tool that responses more accurately than the normal candle sticks to the nature and characteristics of the FOREX market. Subsequently, the parameters of the trading strategy (or system) are calibrated for eight currency pairs, over a period of four years (2006–2009), by comparing the performance of three global search derivative-free optimization algorithms. Then, the returns of the developed system are tested for the next seven years (2010–2016) for each pair and two types of portfolios are constructed; an equal weighted one and a portfolio based on the Kelly criterion. The ultimate objective of this paper is to create currency portfolios based on a novel optimized trading strategy, which could beat constantly the main investors’ benchmarks (i.e. S&P500, Barclay CTA Index).}

This paper presents a novel, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-trained Quantile Regression Neural Network namely PSOQRNN, to forecast volatility from financial time series. We compared the effectiveness of PSOQRNN with that of the traditional volatility forecasting models, i.e., Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) and three Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) including Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), General Regression Neural Network (GRNN), Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH), Random Forest (RF) and two Quantile Regression (QR)-based hybrids including Quantile Regression Neural Network (QRNN) and Quantile Regression Random Forest (QRRF). The results indicate that the proposed PSOQRNN outperformed these models in terms of Mean Squared Error (MSE), on a majority of the eight financial time series including exchange rates of USD versus JPY, GBP, EUR and INR, Gold Price, Crude Oil Price, Standard and Poor 500 (S&P 500) Stock Index and NSE India Stock Index considered here. It was corroborated by the Diebold–Mariano test of statistical significance. It also performed well in terms of other important measures such as Directional Change Statistic (Dstat) and Theil's Inequality Coefficient. The superior performance of PSOQRNN can be attributed to the role played by PSO in obtaining the better solutions. Therefore, we conclude that the proposed PSOQRNN can be used as a viable alternative in forecasting volatility.}

In particular, the artificial intelligent risk management system (AIRMS) is presented that introduces one of the first efforts in the literature to utilize supervised ML as a risk management tool. Two AIRMSs systems are developed based on two well-known ML algorithms, i.e. artificial neural networks and decision trees. These two systems are applied into the five major currency pairs (FOREX) using signals obtained from an existing technical breakout trading strategy introduced in previous study by the authors, covering a seven-year period (2010–2016). Technical indicators and times series of the past entry points feed AIRMS in order to classify produced signals from the trading strategy into two classes: profitable and not. Constructing new portfolios using signals classified only as profitable resulted in an increased profit of more than 50% compared to the original ones. In this work, technical improvements are also proposed on the application of ML algorithms to financial data related to evaluation metrics and smoothing inputs. The obtained results revealed that the two AIRMSs can achieve impressive improvements to the performance of already profitable portfolios and proved that using ML to build risk management tools is very promising.}

The network is also examined with few other meta-heuristic learning techniques and compared with other state of art models. Empirically the model validation is realized over three currency exchange data sets such as USD/CAD, USD/CHF, and USD/JPY accumulated within same period of time.

Due to the high volatility in the forex market, it is difficult to predict the future price of any currency pair. This study shows that a significant enhancement in the prediction of forex price can be achieved by incorporating domain knowledge in the process of training machine learning models. The proposed system integrates the Forex Loss Function (FLF) into a Long Short-Term Memory model called FLF-LSTM — that minimizes the difference between the actual and predictive average of Forex candles. Using the data of 10,078 four-hour candles of EURUSD pair, it is found that compared to the classic LSTM model, the proposed FLF-LSTM system shows a decrease in overall mean absolute error rate by 10.96%. It is also reported that the error in forecasting the high and low prices is reduced by 10% and 9%, respectively. The proposed model, in comparison to the Recurrent Neural Network-based prediction system, shows an overall reduction of 73.57% in mean absolute error, by exhibiting up to 68.71% and 72.31% error reduction in high and low prices, respectively. In comparison to Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average, our proposed model shows a 13% reduced error. Specifically, in the open, high, and low prices, the error is reduced by 28.5%, 14.2%, 9.3%, respectively. Finally, we compare our model with another well-known time series forecasting model, i.e., FB Prophet — where FLF-LSTM demonstrates 31.8%, 47.7%, 23.6%, 47.7% error reduction in open, high, low, and close prices, respectively.

In this work, a new algorithm capable of generating technical rules to make investments with a given amount of leverage depending on the certainty of the prediction is presented. To forecast those predictions, a combination of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm – to identify and classify the market in three different stages –, and a Dynamic Genetic Algorithm – to optimize trading rules in each type of market, is used. The optimization of the trading rules is based on several technical indicators. Forex data for the EUR/USD currency pair, in a timeframe between the years of 2003 and 2016, is used as training and test data. The proposed architecture for the machine learning system, as well as the implementation and study of the proposed system is described in detail. The use of an hybrid system, combining a SVM and a GA with dynamic approaches such as hyper-mutation and adaptability approaches by training three different GA’s for each type of market, provide a new approach for FOREX trading, where it is possible to classify trends using price sequences and therefore using the same classification for optimizing investment strategies with the most appropriate GA. Finally, the work shows promising results during the test period between the 2nd of January of 2015 until the 2nd of March of 2016, where the Return on Investment obtained is 83%.}

Not only because of its importance in terms of financial and commercial values, but more it vitally poses a real challenge to worldwide researchers and quants owing to its highly chaotic and almost unpredictable nature. This paper devises an innovative Chaotic Oscillatory Multi-agent-based Neuro-computing System (a.k.a. COSMOS) for worldwide financial prediction and intelligent trading. With the adoption of author's theoretical works on Lee-oscillator with profound transient-chaotic property, COSMOS effectively integrates chaotic neural oscillator technology into: 1) COSMOS Forecaster - Chaotic FFBP-based Time-series Supervised-learning agent for worldwide financial forecast and; 2) COSMOS Trader - Chaotic RBF-based Actor-Critic Reinforcement-learning agents for the optimization of trading strategies. COSMOS not only provides a fast reinforcement learning and forecast solution, more prominently it successfully resolves the massive data over-training and deadlock problems which usually imposed by traditional recurrent neural networks and RBF networks using classical sigmoid or gaussian-based activation functions. From the implementation perspective, COSMOS is integrated with 2048-trading day time-series financial data and 39 major financial signals as input signals for the real-time prediction and intelligent agent trading of 129 worldwide financial products which consists of: 9 major cryptocurrencies, 84 forex, 19 major commodities and 17 worldwide financial indices. In terms of system performance, past 500-day average daily forecast performance of COSMOS attained less 1% forecast percentage errors and with promising results of 8–13% monthly average returns.}

abstract = {The foreign exchange (FOREX) market is a financial market in which participants, such as international banks, companies or private investors, can both invest in and speculate on exchange rates. This market is considered one of the largest financial markets in the world in terms of trading volume. Indeed, the just-in-time price prediction for a currency pair exchange rate (e.g. EUR/USD) provides valuable information for companies and investors as they can take different actions to improve their business. This paper introduces a new algorithm, inspired by the behaviour of macromolecules in dissolution, to model the evolution of the FOREX market, called the ENMX (elastic network model for FOREX market) algorithm. This algorithm allows the system to escape from a potential local minimum, so it can reproduce the unstable nature of the FOREX market, allowing the simulation to get away from equilibrium. ENMX introduces several novelties in the simulation of the FOREX market. First, ENMX enables the user to simulate the market evolution of up to 21 currency pairs, connected, and thus emulating behaviour of the real-world FOREX market. Second, the interaction between investors and each particular quotation, which may introduce slight deviations from the quotation prices, is represented by a random movement. We analyse different probability distributions like Gaussian and Pseudo-Voigt, the latter showing better behaviour distributions, to model the variations in quotation prices. Finally, the ENMX algorithm is also compared to traditional econometric approaches such as the VAR model and a driftless random walk, using a classical statistical and a profitability measure. The results show that the ENMX outperforms both models in terms of quality by a wide margin.}

The aim of the optimization consisting in finding the best window length, the number of windows and the number of intervals is to increase the predictive efficiency of the transition matrices. In the categories of expert systems, the presented computer program can be considered as imitating and replacing the investor in his manual activity and strongly supporting his mental effort. Two completely different time series were considered: the EUR/USD 1 h currency pair, and the WIG20 1d – the most important Polish stock exchange index. In both cases, the satisfactory adaptability of the proposed method was demonstrated, along with very good properties enabling the building of an effective investment strategy. Essential tests were performed for first-order Markov chains. These tests were also used for comparing the results of the study based on a Markov model of the second-order, which also achieved good results.}
