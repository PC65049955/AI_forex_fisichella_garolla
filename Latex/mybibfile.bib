abstract="This paper describes a hybrid model formed by a mixture of regression techniques and Cuckoo Search algorithm to speculate USD/EUR variations. Inspired by ARMA model we propose a dataset composed of historical data of USD/EUR and (JYN, EUR and BRP) variations. The dataset is used to train four regression algorithms: Multiple linear regression, Support vector regression, Partial Least Squares regression and CRT regression tree; the generated regression weights of these algorithms will be used as inputs to Cuckoo Search algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed system against classical regression algorithms is confirmed by experiments on exchange rate prediction within the period from January 2014 to January 2016.",

@article{Serjam18,
	abstract = {We generate a large number of predictive models by applying linear kernel SVR to historical currency rates'bid data for three currency pairs obtained from high-frequency trading. The bid tick data are converted into equally spaced (1 min) data. Differences of price between the previous successive timeframes are used as features to predict the direction of movement of the price in the next timeframe. Different values for the number of training samples, number of features, and the length of the timeframes are used when learning the models. These models are used to conduct simulated currency trading in the year following the one in which the model was learned. Profits (sum of realized differences in best bid prices when order is executed), hit ratios, and number of trades executed using these models are recorded. The experiments indicate that while it is difficult to construct models using only historical data that consistently perform well, there are models that show good performance under certain pre-defined conditions, and that many of these models have an interesting property. Upon examining the parameters of these models, we discover that they have all negative coefficients and a negligibly small intercept, while having positive profits and good hit ratio. This suggests a simple yet effective trading strategy. Finally, we examine the historical data to find corroboration for the pattern suggested by the generated models and present the results.},

abstract = {This work focuses on the development of a technical breakout trading strategy based on the Donchian Channel approach, aiming to the construction of profitable portfolios. In this direction, the Modified Renko Bars (MRBs) were developed first; that proved to be a useful trading tool that responses more accurately than the normal candle sticks to the nature and characteristics of the FOREX market. Subsequently, the parameters of the trading strategy (or system) are calibrated for eight currency pairs, over a period of four years (2006–2009), by comparing the performance of three global search derivative-free optimization algorithms. Then, the returns of the developed system are tested for the next seven years (2010–2016) for each pair and two types of portfolios are constructed; an equal weighted one and a portfolio based on the Kelly criterion. The ultimate objective of this paper is to create currency portfolios based on a novel optimized trading strategy, which could beat constantly the main investors’ benchmarks (i.e. S&P500, Barclay CTA Index).}

abstract = {Accurate forecasting of volatility from financial time series is paramount in financial decision making. This paper presents a novel, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-trained Quantile Regression Neural Network namely PSOQRNN, to forecast volatility from financial time series. We compared the effectiveness of PSOQRNN with that of the traditional volatility forecasting models, i.e., Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) and three Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) including Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), General Regression Neural Network (GRNN), Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH), Random Forest (RF) and two Quantile Regression (QR)-based hybrids including Quantile Regression Neural Network (QRNN) and Quantile Regression Random Forest (QRRF). The results indicate that the proposed PSOQRNN outperformed these models in terms of Mean Squared Error (MSE), on a majority of the eight financial time series including exchange rates of USD versus JPY, GBP, EUR and INR, Gold Price, Crude Oil Price, Standard and Poor 500 (S&P 500) Stock Index and NSE India Stock Index considered here. It was corroborated by the Diebold–Mariano test of statistical significance. It also performed well in terms of other important measures such as Directional Change Statistic (Dstat) and Theil's Inequality Coefficient. The superior performance of PSOQRNN can be attributed to the role played by PSO in obtaining the better solutions. Therefore, we conclude that the proposed PSOQRNN can be used as a viable alternative in forecasting volatility.}

abstract = {For the prediction of exchange rate, this paper proposes a hybrid learning frame work model which is a joint estimation of On-Line Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM) along with optimized feature reduction using Krill Herd (KH). The proposed learning scheme is compared with Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Recurrent Back Propagation Neural Network (RBPNN), considering three factors such as; without feature reduction, with statistical based feature reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and with optimized feature reduction techniques such as KH, Bacteria Foraging Optimization (BFO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The models are applied over USD/INR, USD/EURO, YEN/INR and SGD/INR, constructed using technical indicators and statistical measures considering 3, 5, 7, 12 and 15 as window sizes. The results of comparisons of different performance measures in testing phase and MSE in training process demonstrate that the proposed OSELM-KH exchange rate prediction model is potentiality superior compared to others.}

We employ a genetic algorithm to evolve a diverse set of profitable trading rules based on weighted moving average method. We use the daily closing rates between four pairs of currencies -- EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, USD/CHF -- to develop and evaluate our method. Results are presented for all four currency pairs over the 16 years from 2000 to 2015. Developed approach yields acceptably high returns on out-of-sample data. The rules obtained using our genetic algorithm result in significantly higher returns than those produced by rules identified through exhaustive search.",
