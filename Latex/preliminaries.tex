\subsection{Trading System: Meta Trader 5}

\subsection{Technical indicators}
In our trading system, XX technical indicators are used as the basis of trading rules. These technical indicators are: Adaptive Moving Average, Average Directional Moving Index, Bollinger Bands, Double Exponential Moving Average, Envelope Moving Avarage, Parabolic SAR, Fractal Adaptive Moving Avarage, Standard Deviation, Triple Exponential Moving Average, Avarage True Range, Bears Power, Bulls Power, MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), Stochastic oscillator, William' Percentage Range, Momentum, RSI (Relative Strength Index), and Heiken Ashi Candles.

\subsection{Genetic Algorithm}
The unstable and chaotic structure of excharges in FX market complicates forecast analysis. This leads to the utilization of optimisation methods. There are many heuristic methods, such as genetic algorithm (GA), simulated annealing (SA), etc. to resolve optimisation problems. GA is one of the most popular heuristic optimisation approach that generates options which evolve in time. GA is based totally on evolution and genetics. Heuristic strategies yield nearly but not necessarily optimal solution with reasonable computational effort and time.

Genetic algorithm refers to the heuristic algorithm, which offers an acceptable answer to the hassle in the majority of virtually practically significant cases, however the correctness of the decisions has no longer been tested mathematically, and is used most frequently for problems, the analytical solution of which is very hard or even impossible.

Heuristic algorithms are extensively used for fsolving problems of high computational complexity, alternatively of going via all of the options, which takes up a considerable quantity of time.
