\section{Preliminaries}

\subsection{Trading}
In first instance, an order is a request to make a trade to open a position.
A trade is made when the order is matched to a counterpart, i.e a buyer has found a seller, or vice versa.
Once a trade is opened, it constitutes a position. A position is exposure to the market and will move the balance in the account up or down in line with market movements.

Finally, placing an order to close a position will result in an trade opposite to the direction initially took, e.g. if we initially bought, now we sell to close.
